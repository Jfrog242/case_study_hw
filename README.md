# BlockFi --The new Crypto Lending Company

## Overview and Origin

* The name of the company is BlockFi and was incorporated and launched in 2017 and was founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez.

* The company was created with the goal of providing credit services to markets with limited access to simple products like a savings account with the goal providing institutional lending rates to retail customers. 

* The company was funded through 10 funding rounds with a total of 508 MM being raised with the last raise of a Series D of 350 MM. 




## Business Activities:
 * The company is trying to solve the problem of non-institutional customers getting loans for their crypto-backed assets at competitive rates. 

 * There are three primary customers they serve: 1. Market Makers, 2. Institutional traders, 3. is retail customers. BlockFi’s currently has more than 15 billion in assets, covering roughly 250000 clients. This is an increase from a revenue just short of 100 million in 2020. 

 * The largest benefit the company offers is the ability to gain liquidity using your crypto as collateral and receiving up to 8.6 interest. Note, the average savings bank rate is .05 percent per year. 

 * The company uses a variety of technologies to include, Node.js, React, Hubspot, and Nginx. Much of the site currently doesn’t require extensive algorithmic computation, but more of smart database storage and compliance. 


## Landscape:

* Looking at the financial landscape—platform like Blockfi are gaining in popularity over the past 5 years. This is due to the decrease in tradional banking interests rates and prohibitive regulations for borrowing money. Furthermore, the explosion of crypto value has uncovered a new asset class that is able to be used as collateral for back a loan. This is something that other traditional banks have been unable to do. 

* There are other competitors in this space like Nexus, Celsius and Kraken that offer similar services and rates. 



## Results

* To date, blockfi continues to gain new customer bases producing Since the end of 2019, it grew its client base from 10,000 to over 250,000 as of today. The primary metric used in this category in assets under management which is now at over 15 Billion up from 100 Million only 12 months earlier.

* In comparison, Blockfi’s top competitor--Celsius Network’s AUM grew from 3 Billion to roughly 9 Billion from November 2020 to March 2021. This increase, while not at Blockfi levels, presents itself as a formidable competitor in the space. 

## Recommendations

* If I were advising the company, I would suggest expanding their credit card services to incorporate a sidecar offering of crypto tokens along side their rewards. This rewards program could be used in partnership with hotels, movie theaters etc to drive usage of their credit card. Increase usage would result in not only cash back but also more tokens which could be exchanged for discounts at vendors and retailers.

* Using these tokens could create a sub economy that could be traded on public exchanges and with increase in usage creating a decrease in surplus ultimately driving higher prices for the value of each token. To integrate this side car, more technologies would need to be integrated with their credit card system. Usage of relational databases, such as Nosequel and increased access to consumer data using python would be suggested technology integrations.
